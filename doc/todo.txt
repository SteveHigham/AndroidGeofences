Android Geofences - Todo.txt
===================

Notifications.

These are working but after issuing a notification I get spurious
additional entries into the fence events list.

I think this may be a conseqeunece of the intent flags I am using in the
BroadcastReceiver. I am currently setting
  Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK |
      Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK

This is strange because the broadcast sends a message to the
DisplayLocationActivity which then refreshes its display.

The application list of fence crossing events is updated by the
BroadcastReceiver.
 I want to see what's happening in a number of use cases as follows.

1) 	Application installed but not run.

Expectation: No notifications as the fences have not been registered.

Observations: This is difficult to reproduce on the emulator. However
repositioning the device whilst the "Request Permissions Screen" is
showing does not display any notifications.

2)	Application has no permissions.

Expectation: No notifications as the fences have not been registered.

Observations: Confirmed.

3)	      Application has forground permissions only.

Expectation: No notifications as the fences have not been registered.

Observations: Confirmed.

4)	      Application has background permissions.

Expectations: Notifications should be received.

On starting app inside fence one notification is received. This is an
enter. The show displays the location inside the fence.
I now close the app and relocate to outside the fence. No event is
raised. I reopen the app. A notification is received but the display
notifcation page is not updated. Show events now shows two enter
events!
Let's repeat but now relocate whilst Display Location page is visible.
No immediate response. We will force by get current location.
Exit event raised according to LogCat. This is confirmed by Fence
Events.

Now click the notification! returns to Fence Events with no
problems. Back key exits the application which is reasonable.

Entering the app again triggers an additional exit event! I now have
the following:
16:57	ENTER
16:59	EXIT
17:02	EXIT

Every time I click a notification I get a spurious exit event. This
occurs whenever I enter the app. Am I re-registering the fences every
time?

Additional logging shows Application.addFences called twice on
startup!

I think both are coming from DisplayLocationActivity. Once from the
OnCreate call and once from the OnResume call.

OnCreate calls initialiseGeofencing () which calls app.initGeofencing
(this);

OnResume calls app.addFences (this) iff
( app.isGeofencingInitialised () &&
      (app.getStatus () == GeofencesApplication.Status.DEFAULT) )

I have removed the call to addFences from initialiseGeofencing ().
Problem solved. :-)
